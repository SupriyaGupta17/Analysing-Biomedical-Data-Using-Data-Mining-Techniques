*********Steps to be followed to run K-Means Clustering Code code*******************

1. Store all the input files in the same folder as the one that contains the code file (kMeans_Clustering.py).
2. Make sure the libraries numpy, matplotlib and sklearn are installed. 
3. Run kMeans_Clustering.py from any python IDE or command prompt using the command "python kMeans_Clustering.py".
4. It will now prompt to enter the data file name, enter the name of input file here.
5. It will then prompt to enter the k value, enter the number of cluster required here.
6. The plot showing the cluster assignment and external index values will be displayed. 

*********Steps to be followed to run Hierarchical Clustering Code code*******************

1. Store all the input files in the same folder as the one that contains the code file (Hierarchical_Clustering.py).
2. Make sure the libraries numpy, matplotlib and sklearn are installed. 
3. Run Hierarchical_Clustering.py from any python IDE or command prompt using the command "python Hierarchical_Clustering.py".
4. It will now prompt to enter the data file name, enter the name of input file here.
5. It will then prompt to enter the number of cluster, enter the number of cluster required here.
6. The plot showing the cluster assignment and external index values will be displayed. 


*********Steps to be followed to run DBSCAN Clustering Code code*******************

1. Store all the input files in the same folder as the one that contains the code file (DBSCAN_Clustering.py).
2. Make sure the libraries numpy, matplotlib and sklearn are installed. 
3. Run DBSCAN_Clustering.py from any python IDE or command prompt using the command "python DBSCAN_Clustering.py".
4. It will now prompt to enter the data file name, enter the name of input file here with the extension.
5. It will then prompt for eps and minPts values.
6. The plot showing the cluster assignment and external index values will be displayed.


*********Steps to be followed to run Map-Reduce K-Means Clustering Code code*******************
1.Place the mapper.py,main.py and reducer.py file in one folder.
2.In the same folder keep the initial centroid file containing k centroids.
3.Have an output directory configured to store the output file.
4.Just run python main.py.The main.py will call the hadoop map reducer command internally using os system call.
