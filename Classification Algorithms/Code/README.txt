*********Steps to be followed to run K-NN code*******************

1. Store all the input files in the same folder as the one that contains the code file (KNN.py).
2. Make sure the libraries numpy, operator and scipy are installed. 
3. Run KNN.py from any python IDE or command prompt using the command "python KNN.py".
3. It will prompt asking if the input will be a single file or seperate training and test files.
4. Based on the input from the previous step, it will now prompt to enter the data file/files name, enter the name of input file/files here.
5. It will then prompt to enter the number of nearest neighbours(k-value), enter the number of nearest neighbours to be considered.
6. The performance measure(accuracy, precision, recall and f1-measure) values will be displayed as output.


*********Steps to be followed to run Naïve Bayes code*******************

1. Store all the input files in the same folder as the one that contains the code file (Naive_Bayes.py).
2. Make sure the libraries numpy and scipy are installed. 
3. Run Naive_Bayes.py from any python IDE or command prompt using the command "python Naive_Bayes.py".
4. It will now prompt to enter the data file name, enter the name of input file here.
5. It will then prompt to enter the type of validation to be done:
	1. If query based validation is to be done choose option 1 and enter the query when prompted.
	2. If k fold cross validation is to be done choose option 2
6. The output displayed will be:
	1. class probability for each class and predicted class for option 1
	2. performance measure(accuracy, precision, recall and f1-measure) values for option 2 
	

*********Steps to be followed to run Desicion Tree code*******************

1.Store the input file DecisionTree.py and tree.py in the same folder.
2.Make sure numpy is installed.
3.Run DecisionTree.py from any python IDE or command prompt using the command "python DecisionTree.py" 
4.It will prompt for input file name and  some user specified parameters.
5.The constructed tree and the performance measures are displayed.


*********Steps to be followed to run Random Forests code*******************

1.Store the input file RandomForest.py and tree.py in the same folder.
