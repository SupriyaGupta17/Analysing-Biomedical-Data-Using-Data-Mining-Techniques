## Analysing-Biomedical-Data-Using-Data-Mining-Techniques

1. Implemented Apriori algorithm to generate frequent item sets and mined association rules for various support and confidence values. 
2. Projected multidimensional dimensional data to 2D using PCA for better visualisation.
3. Implemented K-means, Hierarchical Agglomerative and density-based clustering, compared the results of the three algorithms using external index(Rand Index and Jaccard Coefficient). 
4. Visualized the clustering results using PCA and scatter plot. 
5. Also implemented parallel K-means using MapReduce by setting up a single node hadoop cluster and compared it with non-parallel k-means.
6. Implemented K Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree and Na√Øve Bayes classification algorithms, Random Forest and Boosting based on decision tree implementation.
7. Adopted 10-fold Cross Validation and evaluated the performance of all implemented classification methods in terms of Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F-1 measure.
