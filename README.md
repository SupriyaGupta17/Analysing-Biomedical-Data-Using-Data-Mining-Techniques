## Analysing-Biomedical-Data-Using-Data-Mining-Techniques

1. Implemented Apriori algorithm to generate frequent item sets and mined association rules for various support and confidence values. 
2. Projected multidimensional dimensional data to 2D using PCA for better visualisation and analysis of various associated diseases present in data set.
3. Implemented K-means, Hierarchical Agglomerative with Single Link (Min) and density-based clustering to find clusters of genes that exhibit similar expression profiles. 
4. Validated the results of the three clustering algorithms using external index(Rand Index and Jaccard Coefficient). 
5. Visualized the clustering results using PCA and scatter plot. 
6. Also implemented parallel K-means using MapReduce by setting up a single node hadoop cluster and compared the results with that of non-parallel k-means.
7. Implemented K Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree and Na√Øve Bayes classification algorithms on the biomedical data set to classify diseases as per their similar genes.
8. Also implemented Random Forest and Boosting based on decision tree implementation for analyzing the gene data set.
9. Adopted 10-fold Cross Validation and evaluated the performance of all implemented classification methods in terms of Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F-1 measure.
